what is Git?
Git is a version control system for tracking 
changes in computer files and coordinating work on those 
files among multiple people. 

what is version control?
Version control is important for documents that undergo a 
lot of revision and redrafting and is particularly important 
for electronic documents because they can easily be changed by 
a number of different users. 

Fork a project from the website then open git bash

CLONING A PROJECT:
git clone https://github.com/vishnukalyan/portfolio-1.git

To see the existing branches:
git branch
>* master
* indicates the current working branch

CREATING A NEW BRANCH:
git branch branch_name
EX: git branch vishnu

After the branch is created it will be shown when we use git branch

git branch
>* master
>vishnu

SWICHING TO ANOTHER BRANCH:
EX: git checkout vishnu
>switched to branch 'vishnu'

CHECKING THE WORKING BRANCH:
git branch
>master
>* vishnu

Now we can see the * symbol is shifted to new branch
so we are working withe the new branch

Next we will make some changes in the code(README file is updated) then

git status
>On branch vishnu
>Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
		modified:   README.md

The changes made are shown in red colour

ADDING THE MODIFIED FILES:
git add . => adds all files
git add file_name =>add the particular file
EX: git add README.md

COMMITING THE CHANGES:
git commit -m "Msg Here"
EX: git commit -m "initial commit"
  > 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)

m stands for message and commiting with the correct message is always helpfull

CONFIG:
git config --global user.name vishnukalyan
git config --global user.email vishnukalyan77@gmail.com

PUSHING:
git push origin branch_name
EX: git push vishnu
